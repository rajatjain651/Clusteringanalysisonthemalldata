We have been approached by a manager of mall to give a insight to them to improvise their businees strategy to increase the sales and revenues.

The mall has a membership card system which contains the information about the members such as name age gender annual income and the purchase history.
using the the purchase history and their income they have developed a new variable spending score range 1 to 100.
the mall manager has asked us to group the people based on the given details to give some insight to the manager on the details about the customers purchasing behaviour. 

so we are going to approach this question in two ways using two differnet clustering algorithms that are K-means clustering and Heirarchical clustering.

in k-means elbow method was used to find optimal no. of clusters and that came out to be 5.

In heirarchical clustering the dendrogram method was implemented to get the optimal clusters and that too came out to be the same value i.e. 5.
